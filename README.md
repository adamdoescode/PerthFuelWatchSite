# Adam's fuel app!

This is gonna look so damn cool ðŸ˜Ž

~ Adam

## TODO

- [ ] setup <button> to request current fuel data
- [ ] setup <button> to request directions to a petrol station
  - [ ] this also needs a way to get current location
  - [ ] or manual input
  - [ ] link this to the osrm docker image to actually get data
  - [ ] parse data and return instructions (as a new page?)
- [ ] do proper styling for the front end so it looks okay - should try using bootstrap for this

## setup <button> to request current fuel data

Not sure how to do this? I think I want to use something like Flask.
